    "text": "Tony and Kaitlin are getting married this coming August. They met at Oregon State University with the same major in computer science. They both really like and took a few of Rob Hess’s classes since they were very practical and useful. \n\nThis final project for CS 499 is a website for Tony & Kaitlin’s wedding information. The website introduces the story between Tony and Kaitlin, provides wedding information, showcases pictures of Tony and Kaitlin, and includes registration for the wedding itself."
