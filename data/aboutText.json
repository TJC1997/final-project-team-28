    "text": "Hello! This is Tony Chen. I was born in Beijing on Nov,5th,1997. My Chinese name is Yuhang Chen(陈宇航). My grandpa named me Yuhang and it means universe travel. My dad was an aircraft mechanical engineer and China was designing their first Rocket, so my grandpa hopes I can be an Astronaut. (Obviously it is not possible since I wear glasses in middle school lol). \n\nI grow up in my grandparents' house in Beijing for 18 years. My grandparents were soldiers, so my house was in an army compound. I felt blessed to live with my grandparents. I made many good friends and I learned many good virtues from my grandparents -- honest, upright, loyal, friendly, kind, etc. \nBeijing is a very historical and cultural city, I grow up visiting the Forbidden City, the Great Wall, the Summer Palace, etc. Chinese school taught me a lot about Confucius thinking and Chinese history with traditional thinking. They helped me to form views on the world, life, and values. \n\nBeijing is also a modern city. I love going to the shopping mall with my friends. We can watch movies, sing karaoke, eat at restaurants. I was influenced by my parents, so I am a huge foodie. The only thing I care about during my travel is the new food I can try! I grow up playing basketball and soccer. I went to the 2008 Olympic basketball final between the USA and Spain. The Wukesong Stadium was only 3 blocks away from my home!"

Her favorite ride is Thunder Mountain Railroad. She loves all types of rides though. The feature that is most special about Disneyland is the feel. It always provides a magical atmosphere. \n\nKaitlin loves the beach. Growing up, her family went camping at the coast every year. She loves walking on the beach. The Oregon coast is special because you can walk for miles on nice white sand beach. She also loves seeing all the different light houses at the coast. Many towns have different lighthouses that are all a little different from each other. Also, every coastal town has their own little shopping area. She loves browsing the different shops. They all have their own unique features. \n\nKaitlin is close with her family. She has two brothers and lots of cousins. Her family always did lots growing up. They would go camping, hiking, Disneyland, and more. She is so thankful for her family and all the support they provided her growing up."

    "title": "How We Met",
    "text": "The first time we met is at the CS160 Lecture which was taught by Professor Jennifer. However, we didn't know each other and never talked during the class.\n\nIn the Fall of 2018, I joined the Christian Co-op house -- Courtyard. We started to get to know each other more by living in the same co-op house. We went to a lot of house events together -- Basketball game, Football game, winter retreat, prom night. Since we are both Computer Science students, we study for class and work on projects together. \n\nIn the summer of 2019, we both went to a summer internship in Portland at different companies. Through the events and study together, we were very close as friends. I love sharing the Chinese culture, food, and ideas with Kaitlin. Kaitlin loves explaining the American culture and thinks to me"
